Declarative Frontend Operator for Kubernetes

## Concepts

**Kubernetes** is a container-orchestration system.

**Kubernetes controller** is the logic behind most objects, both built-in and added as extension of Kubernetes. Kubernetes runs a group of controllers that take care of routine tasks to ensure the desired state of the cluster matches the observed state.

**Kubernetes operator** is one kind of the controllers, which orchestrates objects of a specific kind, with some domain logic implemented inside. Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components.

**Code as data** is a concepts where computer code is treated as data, or data executed as code Program execution is controlled by data elements that are not sequences of commands.

**First-class functions** are functions that can be accessed as entities in the language.

**Self-modifying code** is the capability of a language to alter its own instructions while it is executing.

**JSON Schema** is a vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

**Finite-state machine** an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

**Statechart Diagrams** is a type of diagram to describe the behavior of systems.

**Declarative Frontend Operator** is a Kubernetes Operators to dynamically generate Application Frontend based on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition.
